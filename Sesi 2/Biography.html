            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Jakarta and grew up a very shy but curious child.
                Always staying proactive, I ventured into a lot of different history books
                because it's vacinating to learn about what happened in the past. In high
                school, I joined a group called MPK
                <em>(Majelis Perwakilan Kelas)</em>
                to honed my leadership skill.
                <br><br>

                learn new stuff and meet new people!</p>
